This is a fully responsive HTML & CSS website with animations!

In this I use:

* Use CSS variables
* Import CSS files into other CSS files
* Use flex and position properties in CSS
* Create smooth and subtle animations
* Use the BEM naming method
* Maintain a well-organized file and folder structure
* Embrace the principles of writing clean code
